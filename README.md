# Medicare Payments - Fall 2017

This project explores differences in prices charged for various services between hospitals and independent physicians. Medicare reimbursement payments to providers are used as a proxy for service prices.  

Data is derived from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment [dataset](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier).

This work was conducted for a final project in a course on health care economics.
